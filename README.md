This is an implementation of the [Centipede video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game)). It is written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) using the [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com/) game engine, and should be supported by all [target platforms](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/haxeflixel-targets/) that HaxeFlixel supports (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Web, etc.).
